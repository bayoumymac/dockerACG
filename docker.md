# Docker

docker containers are way faster to spin up compared to virtual machines,

### **Containers vs virtual machines**

Think of containers as apartments and virtual machines as houses where docker contianers are better used to isolate applications versus virtual machines which are better used to isolate systems

combining docker containers with virtual machines makes for faster deployment times as spinning up a container is much faster than manually installing the required dependicies

another important concept is the hypervisor and its 2 different types, which is responsible orchastrating the simulation of virutal machines through either the OS (type 2) or hardware directly (type 1)


### **Docker release cycle**
